<h2>Background</h2>

Powercreep, a prevalent concept in gaming, including the Pokemon franchise, involves the gradual escalation of power in new game content when compared to older elements. In Pokemon, this phenomenon can be almost directly measured through Smogon usage rates, which are published monthly. These usage rates reflect the popularity of specific Pokémon in competitive battles, and they provide a tangible indicator of how powercreep impacts the metagame. 

The implications of powercreep extend beyond just raw stats; they influence the strategies players employ in battles. As new Pokemon become more powerful, older ones may fall out of favor, altering the dynamics of competitive play. It's a dynamic process where staying up-to-date with the evolving metagame is essential for success. Consequently, the careful balance between introducing exciting new content and maintaining competitive fairness remains a critical challenge for game developers in the Pokémon series. While powercreep has been generally agreed upon to have always existed in some form or the other in Pokemon, the recent generations, 8 and 9, have been particularly egregious.




<h2>Goal</h2>

We aim to both visualize powercreep and find the cause of its manifestation in Pokemon. The writing should be clear enough so that those who only have a cursory understanding of what Pokemon is should be able to understand the analysis.



<h2>Analysis</h2>

Briefly, the main points of analysis will be focused around the distribution of base stats and their totals. Some additional analysis will be done on type distribution and 'special' Pokemon, such as Legendary and Mythical Pokemon.



<h2>Key learnings</h2>

- Despite the last two generations making up over 60% of the top 50 standard play, or OU, Smogon Pokemon, they show comparatively little difference in stat distributions and totals. 
- This suggests the stats have much less to do with the competitive Pokemon metagame than one would think, and what makes a top tier Pokemon lies in movepool and abilities.



<h2>Project status</h2>

Done!
