<h2>Background</h2>

write about what the concept of powercreep is, not just in pokemon but in all games. explanation of base stats and how pokemon works in general. acknowledge that base stats alone do not make a pokemon good. Explain what smogon is



<h2>Goal</h2>

Aim to quantify and show graphically the effects of powercreep on Pokemon over the years in a way that can be understood even by people who dont play pokemon or games in general.



<h2>Analysis</h2>

- general pokemon stats first
- - type distribution and number of pokemon on per gen. show a graph of type resistances from somewhere else and maybe calculate the average "strength" of tyes, both defensively and offensively that way
- - types per gen
- - generally other basic pokemon stuff
- - which pokemon are generally more powerful (spoiler alert, legendaries and pseudo legendaries)

- powercreep stuff
- - base stat totals/speed by generation (most important base stat)
- - min maxing of base stats (pokemon with more specialized roles like physical attackers vs mixed attackers) note: will have to explain this concept briefly
- - move pool power (if able to get smogon data joined or another data source for it, fingers crossed)
- - if get access to smogon usage rates, graph the generations of the top smogon used pokemon in standard play, known as OU. also graph the top threats in Ubers, the highest tier of play. note: will have to explain what the tiers are



<h2>Key learnings</h2>

- prediction is that later gens should generally be more powerful over a number of factors. more of a known fact, but i just want to visualize it here and maybe find some more specific trends and reasons why this is the case



<h2>Project status</h2>

dataset secured, planning analysis and laying out structure of notebook
