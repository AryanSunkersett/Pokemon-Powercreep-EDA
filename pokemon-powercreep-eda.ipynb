    "### **Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "Standing head and shoulders over every single media company and intellectual property group in the world is Pokemon. As the highest grossing media franchise of all time, Pokemon has cemented, no matter how big or small, a place in the minds of almost everyone. Because of the many games and multiplayer features added, communities of hobbyists dedicated to competitive Pokemon battling have developed. \n",
    "\n",
    "These hobbyists have developed remarkably optimized Pokemon teams, and continue to battle online with a thriving competitive scene. Everytime a new generation of Pokemon is released, the online competitive scene has to scramble to adjust to what has been deemed \"powercreep\". Powercreep is a term used throughout gaming to generally refer to the phenomenon of new > old, that is, new content released by the maker of the game more often than not tend to outclass older content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Goal**\n",
    "\n",
    "Leveraging Python libraries, we hope to both quantify and visualize the effect of powercreep. This will be done by analyzing what makes a Pokemon \"strong\", and using that as a metric to view powercreep over the 9 generations of Pokemon."
